# Environment Configurations

Using create-react-app, we will be walking through a few of the configurations we will be adding to our environment to ensure the quality of the codebase.

We will be adding:

- Prettier, our code formatter and style enforcer
- ESLint, our linter and first defense against bugs
- Git Hooks, lets us automatically double check correctness and format
